<!-- Assignment 2.6: "DOM Methods in Practice"  -->
<!-- STARTER CODE -->

<!-- N/A -->

<!-- Description: It's time to do some work on your personal website! You are going to need a navigation bar that can easily direct your visitors (hopefully many software companies) to things like your portfolio projects, a bio, and maybe even your own educational coding blog! You've found an HTML template, but it is far too basic and impersonal for what you need. Use your new DOM skills to update it via JavaScript:
	- Delete & replace the stale "company blurb" text
	- Delete the old sorted list, and
	- Use a loop to create a new one
-->

<!-- STEP 1: Paste the following starter code into a new HTML document -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>Sprint 10, Assignment 2.6 ("DOM Methods in Practice")</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p id="company-blurb">
			Thank you for using our business template -
			<strong>please visit us</strong> for more great <code>code</code>!
		</p>
		<ul id="navBar">
			<li>Home</li>
			<li>Products</li>
			<li>Customer Support</li>
			<li>Careers</li>
			<li>Investors</li>
			<li>News</li>
			<li>About Us</li>
		</ul>
		<script src="./2.6.Assignment.script.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- STEP 2: Create a new javascript file named "2.6.Assignment.script.js" -->
