<!-- 4.4, "Insert JQuery library & Test" -->

<!-- Description: While applying to various companies, you've come across a few who have asked for a working understanding of JQuery in order to deal with their aging code base. Given that you're becoming a JS savant, you have decided to download it and give it a try. Dig up any notes and code files you might have from lesson 3.2 ("JavaScript Events"), because you are going to try and duplicate your vanilla JavaScript code:
add JQuery to a copy of your 3.2 code file (or using the code in step 0),
 -->

<!-- STEP 0: If you were not able to re-create the code from lesson 3.2, paste the following into a new html document: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

			.box {
				width: 200px;
				margin: 10px;
				border: 4px solid black;
				font-size: 300%;
				text-align: center;
				padding: 30px;
			}
		</style>

	<body>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="box" id="box1">Box 1</div>
			<div class="box" id="box2">Box 2</div>
		</div>
		<script src="./4.4.script.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- STEP 1: Go to https://code.jquery.com/ -->
<!-- Note: if this becomes broken, go to https://jquery.com/, click the download tab, and then look for language on the page that includes "to use the jquery CDN" -->

<!-- STEP 2: Select the "minified" version and copy the link  -->
<!-- Note: if, later, you want to look under the hood, go back and examine the "uncompressed" version -->

<!-- STEP 3: Paste what you've copied into your html document -->
<!-- Hint: it can go in the head of your document -->
<!-- Hint: in theory, it is code that normally goes inside of <script> tags. However, see below note: -->
<!-- Note: you should not need to create "script" tags, as what you've copied (likely) already has them.  -->

<!-- STEP 4: Create a new JavaScript file named "4.4.script.js" -->
