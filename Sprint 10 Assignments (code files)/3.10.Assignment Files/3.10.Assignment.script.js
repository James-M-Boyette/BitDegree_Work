// Assignment 3.10: "Create a form with listeners"

// Create a form with listeners
// + Have console.log's that register when any field is selected (for developer debugging)
// + Have the field change background color & text size when onFocus, and revert to regular when on Blur

// STEP 5: Change the styling of your fields' background color to toggle to a different background color when selected with a mouse click (using an event listner).
// Hint: You will need to create CSS styling in your HTML document's "header" section, and refer to it in your JavaScript. Call it something like "border-emphasize".
// Hint: Add a class to each _ and target that with your event listener
// Hint: You can use multiple event listeners to achieve this. Try to make your styling change occur on a mouse's click. 

// STEP 6: Make your fields toggle to their normal background styling when not selected (using an event listener)
// Hint: Use the "toggle" method

// STEP 7: Change the styling of your fields' text color to toggle to a different color (using an event listner)
// Hint: You can use multiple event listeners to achieve this. Try to make your styling change occur on a mouse's click. 

// STEP 8: Make your fields toggle to their normal text styling when not selected (using an event listener)

// BONUS: Make your fields change border thickness or color when the user's mouse enters them (and return to normal when it exits)
