Assignment 2: Add an event handler
Assignment 3: Add mouse and key events

// Notes to self:
- These are easy assignments:
  > Nothing new in those other videos
  > There is some other stuff in the outline etc, but it's not clear to me that these should be relied on ... best to sprinkle one in as a non-essential
  > They are not seperate assignments, either: they are about creating and upgrading a form
  > Should a basic HTML File be supplied? Maybe suggest they build their own, but also provide one in case they struggle

// Aside: This is too much at once for a student. They should have organized both the lesson content and the assignments to tackle one at a time .. but doing it this way will force the student to go back and synthesize something pretty wholly new from what they've seen

  Assignment 1: Create a form with listeners
  > A form should have input fields (3.2)
    + A basic user sign-up would have 8 fields:
        - First Name
        - Last Name
        - Address
        - Apt #
        - City
        - State/Country
        - Phone #
        - 
  > it should have listeners:
    
    + Have console.log's that register when any field is selected (for developer debugging)
    + Have the field change background color & text size when onFocus, and revert to regular when on Blur

Assignment 2: Add an event handler
  > Add the same event handler to each field, logging on 'clickdown' the element
  > Add an alert to the event 'onclick' which says ("Welcome! We're delighted to have you as part of the family!!")
  > Add 'onfocus' and 'onblur' handlers so that we can get a better sense of whether the form is confusing, unengaging etc (logging "user away" and "user returned")

Assignment 3: Add Mouse & Key events
  + Have a console.log for when they click the 'submit' button, saying "user submitted data"
  > Add mouse on and mouse off events for the submit button that make it slightly bigger and highlighted in the first case, and toggle back to normal in the second
  > Test making the form smaller and grayed-out when the window is 'onblur' and normal when 'onfocus' or make the precursor, 'label' text bold and one font-size bigger when entering info
  > Make all fields pre-populated with slightly opaque example text, and have that text disappear when the cursor selects the field to enter data
  > Bonus: add a click/tick-box field with text for offering to sign them up to a newsletter, and a listner that logs a message 'user signed up' in terminal in place of sending data to the server. Have a mouse event change the text to "signed up", the color to something fun and celebratory, and the font or background color to something else exciting (bold/italic in the former case, or good contrast color )
